      <p>
        i hope you are doing good today.
        you stranded on this website in search of info on this guy named salem salleh.<br>
        well i have great news for you! you made your way to the right place.<br>
        it doesnt matter
        <ul>
          <li>if you are interested in his past or his future?</li>
          <li>weather you wonder what he is doing all day long?</li>
          <li>or you are eager to find out what kind of a person he is?</li>
        </ul>
        this is where you get all the answers.<br>

        ok if you ask me to summarize who salem is, i would answer the following<br>
        for his age he is an insanly young looking male version of a human being that was born in the state of hamburg in europe.<br>
        he studied economics and business but struggled to accept that it actually was a real discipline in science.<br>
        but thanks to subjects like statistics and econometrics he was introduced to the basic concepts of programming.<br>
        and that is where his journey began.<br>
        he is now into coding and this website itself is actually the first web dev project he ever started.<br>
        <br>
        so now there is nothing more for me to say then: may the sauce be with you!<br>
